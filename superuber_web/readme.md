# Super Uber DB

This is a **Django** application using a **SQLite3** database. It also includes a pdf file containing a college assignment for database classes.

## Usage

After cloning this repository, you need to install some things.

If you need different Python versions in your computer, you should install a **virtualenv**.

You also need **Django 1.11.2** and **Python 2.7.15**. You can install these things with a `make install`.

Currently this project only has the django admin page working, so you should go straight to _http://localhost:8000/admin_.

The login info I've already created is:

user: admin
password: ahriahri



### How to run the database

`sqlite3 superuberdb.sqlite3`
